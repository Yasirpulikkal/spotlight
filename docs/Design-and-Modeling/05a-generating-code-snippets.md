# Generating Code Snippets

When you are happy with the requests you've made in [Request Haker](./05-request-maker.md) (our HTTP client), you can turn the requests into actual code for pasting into your codebase.

This can reduce the time to first request massively for yourself, for co-workers, or for anyone else viewing the documentation. 

To generate code:

1. From within a project, select any of the API endpoints from the API sidebar menu on the left.
2. When viewing the endpoint, click the **Preview** button at the top right of the screen.
3. From there you can modify a request in any way you want, and click **Code Generation**.

## Selecting a Language

By default you will see the **Shell / cURL** showing up, which is for working on the command line with a very common library called `curl`. 

Click the dropdown on the left to select different languages, most of which support a few different libraries.
