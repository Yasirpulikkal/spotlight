2. Create a **request body** and/or **response body**
3. Within the JSON Schema Viewer, add a new property by clicking the + button or modify an existing property by selecting the property
4. Select **\$ref** in the proceeding window
5. Select a **\$ref target**
6. Select the file you want to reference
