# Mock Servers

Mock servers can be handy throughout the design phase of an API for making sure API descriptions contain the right sort of information. 

Stoplight mock servers are powered by our open-source mock server, [Prism](https://stoplight.io/open-source/prism/). They return realistic data, validate incoming data, check for the existence of headers, security schemes, and more. 

[Stoplight Platform](https://stoplight.io/welcome) users can enjoy the same built-in mocking functionality as well as free hosted mock servers.
