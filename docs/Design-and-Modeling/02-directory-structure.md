## What

### Files Created Within Studio

Stoplight Studio’s directory structure (aka file tree structure) organizes and displays accessible files in Studio. API specific files (API description and models) can be viewed within the **APIs** file tree tab and all files can be viewed within the **Files** tab.

### Files Uploaded to Studio

To publish and modify API description created outside of Studio, they must be stored within `reference/{API-title}`. Models must be stored within `reference/{API-title}/models` . Common models must be stored within `reference/common`.

## How

### Files Created Within Studio

1. [Add an API, Endpoint, or Model via the UI](../Basics/02-working-with-files.md)
2. The file will be visible within the **APIs** file tree tab
3. Switch to the **File** file tree (**optional**)
4. Open the **reference** folder to view created API folders
5. Open the **common** folder to view created Common Models
6. Open individual API folders to view API description documents and API specific models folder

### API Description Documents Uploaded to Studio

1. [Clone your Git Repository](../Basics/01-working-with-projects.md)
2. Click the **+** button and select **Folder** from the dropdown

> Alternative Solution: Right-click on the file tree and select **New Directory**

3. Input **reference** for the new folder/directory name
4. Create another folder (step 2) and input your **APIs name** for the new folder/directory
5. Nest the **APIs name** folder within the **references** folder via drag drop
6. Drag drop existing API description document into the **APIs name** folder
7. That API description will now be accessible in Studio’s APIs file tree

### Model Files Uploaded to Studio

1. [Clone your Git Repository](../Basics/01-working-with-projects.md)
2. Click the **+** button and select **Folder** from the dropdown

> Alternative Solution: Right-click on the file tree and select **New Directory**

3. Input **reference** for the new folder/directory name
4. Create another folder (step 2) and input your **APIs name** for the new folder/directory
5. Nest the **APIs name** folder within the **references** folder via drag drop
6. Create another folder and input **models** for the new folder/directory
7. Nest the **models** folder within the **APIs name** folder
8. Drag drop existing models into the **models** folder
9. Those models are now accessible in Studio’s APIs file tree

### Common Models Uploaded to Studio

1. [Clone your Git Repository](../Basics/01-working-with-projects.md)
2. Click the **+** button and select **Folder** from the dropdown

> Alternative Solution: Right-click on the file tree and select **New Directory**

3. Input **reference** for the new folder/directory name
4. Create another folder (step 2) and input **common** for the new folder/directory
5. Create another folder (step 2) and input **models** for the new folder/directory
6. Drag drop existing common models into the **common/models** folder
7. Those common models are now accessible in Studio’s APIs file tree
