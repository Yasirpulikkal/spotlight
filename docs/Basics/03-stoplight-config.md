# Stoplight Config

The Stoplight config file helps you control which files Stoplight should analyze when project is loaded in Studio, or [published](../Documentation/06-publishing.md) to be read as documentation, etc. This is done with a few keywords such as `"exclude"` to blacklist certain files/folders, and `"formats"` to instruments which files are supposed to be read and parsed as APIs, documentation, or other content. It will also control where new files are created, such as new APIs.

![](../../assets/images/create-api-with-config.gif)

The config file should go in the root of your project, and be named `.stoplight.json`. It can be regular JSON or [JSONC](https://github.com/microsoft/node-jsonc-parser) (i.e JSON with comments, and trailing commas allowed).

## Default Config

Projects with no config file will act as though they had this config:

```json
{
  "formats": {
    "openapi": {
      "rootDir": "reference",
      "include": ["**"]
    },
    "markdown": {
      "rootDir": "docs",
      "include": ["**"]
    },
    "image": {
      "rootDir": "assets/images",
      "include": ["**"]
    },
    "json_schema": {
      "rootDir": "models",
      "include": ["**"]
    }
  }
}
```

Any files with the `openapi` and `json_schema` formats will go under the "APIs" panel, and any files with `markdown` or `images` formats will go under "Docs".

## Reference

### `exclude`

Any file or directory matching the pattern listed in exclude won't be indexed by any part of Stoplight.

> **Note:** There is a fairly large default list of excluded file paths for things like node modules and other common dependency management files, `.cache/`, `.git`, `log/`, `tmp/`, etc. This is done for performance reasons and will be made more observable and configurable in future versions.

### `formats`

- `rootDir` (required) - when `include` is unspecified, all files placed under `rootDir` are marked as included. Used by UI wizards in Studio as a default location for certain kind of files.
- `include` (optional) - at least one pattern needs to match the `rootDir`.

## Example

Maybe a project has multiple APIs in a `apis` directory, some test files that should not be indexed, and some models in a `schemas` directory which you also use for [contract testing](https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog/writing-documentation-via-contract-testing).

```
/project
  /article.md
  /apis/petstore.openapi.yaml
  /apis/address.openapi.json
  /test/todos.openapi.yaml
  /schemas/user.json
  /.stoplight.json
```

To exclude the test files and make it clear which other files are which, the following config can be used:

```json
// .stoplight.json
{
  "formats": {
    "openapi": {
      "rootDir": "reference"
    },
    "json_schema": {
      "rootDir": "models"
    },
  },
  "exclude": ["test"]
}
```
