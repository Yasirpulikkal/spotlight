# Project Config

<!-- Ready for platform migration -->

The Stoplight config file helps you control which files Stoplight should analyze when project is loaded in Studio, or other parts of the Stoplight Platform.

This is done with a few keywords such as `"exclude"` to blacklist certain files/folders, and `"formats"` to instruments which files are supposed to be read and parsed as APIs, documentation, or other content. It will also control where new files are created, such as new APIs.
