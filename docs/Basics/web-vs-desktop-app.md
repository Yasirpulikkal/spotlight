# Studio Desktop vs. Studio Web

Stoplight Studio is available in two different formats: desktop and web. Studio Desktop is an offline-first application that runs locally on your computer. Studio web is a web application that runs purely in your browser. There are a few differences that are outlined below:

## Studio Web

The Studio Web interface is ideal for collaboration and working real time with existing hosted git repositories. IT is also where you will manage all your documentation.
