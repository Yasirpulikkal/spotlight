# Studio Desktop vs. Studio Web

Stoplight Studio is available in two different formats: desktop and web. Studio Desktop is an offline-first application that runs locally on your computer. Studio web is a web application that runs purely in your browser. 

## Studio Web

The Studio Web interface is ideal for collaboration and working real time with existing hosted git repositories. It is also where you will manage all your documentation.

## Studio Desktop

The Studio Desktop application provides an offline-first, native interface for designing and modeling your APIs. It also allows you to work directly with local files and folders on your computer.

## Differences

There used to be a few differences in previous versions, e.g.: publishing was web only and mocking was desktop only, but now they are at feature parity for everything that matters. Studio Web will let you download a project to your computer, but Studio Desktop doesn't need to as the files are already on your computer.
