# Studio Desktop vs. Studio Web

Stoplight Studio is available in two different formats: desktop and web. Studio Desktop is an offline-first application that runs locally on your computer. Studio web is a web application that runs purely in your browser. 

## Studio Web

The Studio Web interface is ideal for collaboration and working real time with existing hosted git repositories. 

In the past it was a standalone tool, but it is now part of the larger [Stoplight Platform](https://stoplight.io/welcome) ecosystem, which provides hosted documentation, an Explorer for searching across multiple APIs, a design library, and all sorts of other powerful stuff.

## Studio Desktop

The [Studio Desktop](https://stoplight.io/studio/) application provides an offline-first, native interface for designing and modeling your APIs. It also allows you to work directly with local files and folders on your computer.

This standalone tool can be used to edit the contents of any projects, whether they're linked to Stoplight Platform or not.
