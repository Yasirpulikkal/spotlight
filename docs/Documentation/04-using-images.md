# Add Images

<!-- Ready for platform migration -->

There are two ways to add images to a project:

- **Drag-and-drop**: This is the easiest and preferred method of adding images, which are stored in Stoplight and respect project permissions (private vs. internal).
- **Import**: For projects connected to Git or another version control system, import files. Use this method if tracking changes to images is important to you or if the image is shared with another publishing tool.

You can add multiple images to any documentation file. Supported  image formats include: **JPEG,** **JPG**, **PNG**, and **GIF**.

For guidance, see [Add Images](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/platform/ZG9jOjc3MTg0NjE-add-images).

## Customize Images

To customize images, such as adding backgrounds, captions or focus, see [images in Stoplight Flavored Markdown](03a-stoplight-flavored-markdown.md).
