1. **Docs File tree**
2. **Create a New File**
3. **Files File tree**

## What

### Files Created Within Studio

Stoplight Studio’s directory structure (aka file tree structure) organizes and displays accessible files in Studio. Documentation specific files (Markdown and image files) can be viewed within the File tree **Docs** tab and all files can be viewed within the **Files** tab.

### Files Uploaded to Studio

To publish and modify Markdown files created outside of Studio, they must be stored within the **docs** folder. To publish and modify images created outside of Studio, they must be stored within the **assets/images** folder.
