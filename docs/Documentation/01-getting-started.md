# Documentation Quickstart Guide

Want to publish documentation? This quick start guide will provide you with the necessary steps to use Studio Desktop to quickly get you from API Specification to ready-to-publish API Documentation.

## 1. Open Studio Desktop

The Studio Desktop start page contains three options: 

* New Local Project 
* Open Git Project
* Open Existing Folder

For now, create a local project.

## 2. Create a New Local Project

1. Provide a name for your project.
2. Select **Include Tutorial Files** to add example files to your project to help you get started. 
3. Select **Create**.

![New Local Project](https://stoplight.io/api/v1/projects/cHJqOjU/images/wOCkrVsW1ds)

The new local project opens. API files and directories listed in the left panel, and the design panel is shown on the right.

## 3. Directory Structure

Studio has some conventions around where API files and documentation files should live.

Learn about [Studio Directory Structure](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/platform/ZG9jOjMxMjkzMTQ1-work-with-files#directory-structure).

## 4. Select Docs

![Select Docs tab](https://stoplight.io/api/v1/projects/cHJqOjU/images/Tfqz2ZXG65k)

Select the **Docs** tab to switch from the API Design workspace to the documentation workspace. This is where all documentation-related files (Markdown files and image files) can be created, managed, modified, and deleted. Because you added tutorial files, the **Docs** tab includes samples of Markdown and image files.

## 5. Modify Existing Markdown Files

> Learn [how to create new Markdown files](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/platform/ZG9jOjMxMjkzMTQ1-work-with-files)

From the Markdown folder, select **basic-syntax**. The **Markdown Bascis** article opens in the main panel. You can modify existing content and create new content. Use the **Code** and **Preview** options to switch between edit and preview modes.

## 6. Use the Stoplight CLI to Publish

For local projects, use the [Stoplight CLI](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/platform/ZG9jOjQ1NTQxMw-publish-with-the-stoplight-cli) to publish your documentation.
