# Documentation Quickstart Guide 

Want to publish documentation? This quick start guide will provide you with the necessary steps to get you from API Specification to ready-to-publish API Documentation in 5 minutes flat. 

## 1. Open Stoplight Studio
The opening page of [Stoplight Studio](https://stoplight.io/p/studio) contains three options: create a **New Personal Project**, Open Git Project, and Open Existing Folder. 

## 2. Create a New Personal Project 
Create a New Personal Project by inputting a **Name**, select **Include Tutorial Files**, and then click **Create**. 

> “Include Tutorial Files” will populate your Project with example files to help get you started

Once you have created a New Personal Project, the first thing you will see is the APIs file tree on the left and the design panel taking up the bulk of the screen space to the right.

The file tree to the left is where all of Stoplight’s Design files (API Specification: endpoints, models, paths, etc.) are stored and the main panel contains the [Table of Contents, API Design GUI, Read View, and Write View](../ui-overview.md). For more on API design, check out the [API Design Quick Start Guide](../Design-and-Modeling/01-getting-started.md). 

## 3. Select Docs

From Studio Home, select the file tree’s **Docs** tab to switch from the API Design workspace to the documentation workspace. This is where all documentation related files (markdown files and image files) can be created, managed, modified, and deleted. Since you selected “Include Tutorial Files,” the left hand file tree will be populated by two folders: markdown and welcome and an Assets folder: Images. 

## 4. Modify Existing Markdown Files 
> Learn [how to create new Markdown files](../Basics/02-working-with-files.md) 

Open the markdown folder and select **Markdown Basics**. The main panel will switch to the markdown editor where you can modify existing content and create new content. Select Save to make changes permanent. You can switch to Read View to preview the file you have selected by selecting Read View in the top right toggle of the main panel.
