# Publishing in Studio

Whenever changes are made to your API descriptions or Markdown documentation, whether that is done in Stoplight Studio or anywhere else, you want to get those changes reflected in Documentation, Mock Servers, Explorer, the Design Library, etc.

In Studio v1.x publishing was done by clicking the "Publish" button, but with the launch of Stoplight Platform publishing can be [automated using Webhooks, or Continuous Integration](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/platform/2.-workspaces/g.automating-publishing.md).
