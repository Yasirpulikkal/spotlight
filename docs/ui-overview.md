# Project UI Overview

Use projects to manage APIs, documentation, and related files. Projects work and look the same in Studio Web and Studio Desktop. This topic describes projects in Studio Web. 

To open a project:

1. From the **Home** page:
   - Select the project from the side panel on the left

     Or

   - Select **Projects** from the tab.

2. Project owners, admins, and editors can select **Edit** to manage the project. Viewers can navigate and read project content. 

Once you are editing a project, there are three key areas of the interface:

1. Project sidebar
2. Project toolbar
3. Code and Preview modes

1. **Project Name**: Shows the name of the current project. 

2. **Project Actions**: Select to you add new assets to your project. This includes APIs, Endpoints, Models, Articles, Images, Files, Folders, and Projects.

3. **Project Sidebar**: Displays an overview of the project in different menu formats. Can toggle between **APIs** (displays APIs, endpoints, and models), **Docs** (for Markdown and image files), **Files** (displaying all project files), and **Git** (for pushing/pulling changes to the connected Git repository).

4. **Primary Panel**: Main editor panel. Can switch between different "views" via the toggle in the top right of the panel (not shown, must hover over panel for toggle to appear).

5. **Secondary Panel**: Additional editor panel, which is only available on larger screens (width > 1400px). Can switch between view types via the view toggle in the top right of the panel, just like the Primary panel.

6. **Mock Server**: Run mock servers (powered by [Prism](https://stoplight.io/prism)) and view mock server logs.

7. **Validation and Linting**: Displays issues related to your API Specification (powered by Spectral). Click to expand window and view error and warning details and locations.

8. **Publish**: Click to publish documentation.
