# Intro

Studio is our next generation app for API design, modeling, and technical writing.

> A primary goal of Studio is to enrich, not replace, your existing workflows. It works offline, with folders and files on your computer, just like your favorite IDEs.

Here is some of what it can do:

- **OpenAPI v2 _and_ v3:** Form based design mode means you don't need to be an OpenAPI expert to get started. Studio also supports OpenAPI autocomplete in write mode, a read mode to visualize HTTP operations and models, mocking, and linting for OpenAPI v2 and v3.
- **Standalone JSON Schema Modeling:** Studio encourages you to split your models into separate files, and then makes it easy to create `$refs` between them.
- **Stoplight Flavored Markdown:** SMD is an optional, lightweight extension CommonMark (a standard form of Markdown). It enables a few advanced features such as tabs and call-outs.
- **Combine Reference and Implementation:** Since Studio works with your local filesystem, you can open up your API projects and start adding docs and designs alongside the actual implementation they are meant to describe. Once you're done, check it all into Git with your favorite Git client!
- **Manage Mock Servers:** When [Prism](https://stoplight.io/prism/) is enabled (in the desktop application only), Studio will automatically start a local mock server for every API defined in your project, and keep it up-to-date as you change your designs.

### A Note on this Personal Space

This initial Studio project template was cloned from the [Studio Templates](https://github.com/stoplightio/studio-templates) Github repository. If you find an error, or have an idea on how to improve this getting started template, please let us know in the issues section of that repository.

We plan to add additional sections on [Prism](https://stoplight.io/prism/) (mocking), [Spectral](https://stoplight.io/spectral/) (linting), working with the filesystem, Git, and more in the future.

This template includes a couple of example APIs (Pet Store and To-dos). You can create a new project, or open another folder on your computer, by clicking the `Project Selector` dropdown in the top left of the Studio UI.
